<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Changes:</strong></p>
<p>- Fixed a crash when running Mo Glass on a server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>v1.6 changes:</strong></p>
<p>- Added tinted glass slabs and stairs.</p>
<p>- Slightly modified the lighting engine to make tinted glass slabs and stairs possible.</p>
<p>- Added Italian (Italy) translations. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/XfedeX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XfedeX</a>!)</p>
<p>- Added French (France) translations. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/HanatakeYurii" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HanatakeYurii</a>!)</p>
<p>- Added various common item tags that other mods can use in their crafting recipes to specify what kind of glass they want.</p>
<p>- Added a "mo_glass:glass_slabs" block tag containing all glass slabs and a "mo_glass:glass_stairs" block tag containing all glass stairs. This should be useful for vertical slabs mods.</p>
<p>- Added a "mo_glass:opaque_for_lighting" block tag for blocks that need my lighting engine modification to render properly. This should be useful for mods that change how lighting works.</p>
<p>- Reduced the file size of Mo Glass. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/RDKRACZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RDKRACZ</a>!)</p>
